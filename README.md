# Date-parser
A small and basic date parser for different date formats, parses to datetime eligble format with the kind help of the dateutil library.

# Description
Originally developed for my RSS project, I needed a date parser because each blog / site had different date formats, so I wrote this in order to be able to sort by date, and for continuity's sake.
